# Project_Info SQL Assignment

## üìò Introduction

This repository presents an SQL-based project schema designed to simulate real-world project management scenarios using MySQL. The focus is on interlinked data modeling and query optimization, including complex joins, subqueries, window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs). The work was carried out in **MySQL Workbench**, and schema visualization helped map relationships among projects, teams, and tasks.

This project demonstrates SQL query writing, data handling using relational schemas, and report generation. 
We worked with three main tables: **Projects**, **Tasks**, and **Teams**, and also included **Model_Training** and **Data_Sets** as per the extended queries.

## Tables Used

- **Projects**: Stores project metadata.
- **Tasks**: Contains information about tasks, their completion status, and deadlines.
- **Teams**: Maps team members and their roles to projects.
- **Model_Training**: Tracks AI models and their accuracy per project.
- **Data_Sets**: Contains dataset size and update information per project.

## Conclusion

In this assignment, I:

- Designed relational tables with appropriate constraints.
- Used **joins**, **window functions**, **subqueries**, and **CTEs** effectively.
- Practiced data analysis using SQL constructs such as `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `CASE`, and aggregation functions.

The queries were validated using MySQL Workbench, and screenshots of the results were collected.
